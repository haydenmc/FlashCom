# LaunchTree

LaunchTree is a work-in-progress launcher UI for Windows.

The goal is to enable power users to quickly navigate their operating system by means of
a transient launcher experience that can be quickly invoked and quickly navigated with minimal
UI, small system footprint, and a highly customizable set of actions.

A tree of keyboard shortcuts is the main means of interaction to maximize efficient navigation.

The application is entirely native code using Windows composition APIs for visual UI to minimize
system footprint and maximize speed.
