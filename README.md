# âš¡ FlashCom

FlashCom is a lightning fast command launcher for Windows power users.

Create a "command tree" to assign a hotkey-based hierarchy to all of your most
common commands, then instantly execute them by invoking FlashCom and traversing
the tree.

**Lightweight, fast, and minimal**: FlashCom is a small Win32 native process
and uses Windows Composition APIs to render beautiful visuals without a heavy
UI framework or bundled browser.

# Usage

Download the [latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/haydenmc/FlashCom/releases/latest),
or [install from the Windows Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P46ZB80RWL8).

Be sure to install the latest
[Microsoft VC Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version)
if you are not using the packaged or Windows Store app.

After launching, FlashCom will appear in your system tray as a pink lightning bolt.

**FlashCom can then be invoked by pressing Win+Space.**

# Settings

To customize the command tree, right click the tray icon and select "Settings,"
then edit the `settings.json` shown.

`settings.json` is used to customize the command tree shown in FlashCom along
with other settings.

For the packaged app, `settings.json` is located in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\164HaydenMcAfee.FlashCom_nqvw84mb3bsjc\LocalState`.

For the unpackaged app, `settings.json` is located in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FlashCom`.

## Commands

| Name         | "type"           | Description                                |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| [ShellExecute Command](#shellexecute-command) | `"shellExecute"` | Launches arbitrary Windows executables. |
| [URI Command](#uri-command) | `"uri"` | Activates the given URI with the default protocol handler. |
| [AUMID Command](#aumid-command) | `"aumid"` | Activates the Windows Packaged app with the given AUMID. |

The `"commands"` field defines the set of commands shown in FlashCom:

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "name": "Calculator",
            "key": "C",
            "type": "shellExecute",
            "executeFile": "calc.exe",
            "executeParameters": ""
        },
        {
            "name": "Notepad",
            "key": "N",
            "type": "shellExecute",
            "executeFile": "notepad.exe",
            "executeParameters": ""
        }
    ]
}
```

A command can be one of several types. The `"type"` field will determine what
happens when the command is executed.

A command can also serve as a container or folder for other commands. These
commands don't have a `"type"` field, but instead have a `"children"` field:

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "name": "Tools",
            "key": "T",
            "children": [
                {
                    "name": "Calculator",
                    "key": "C",
                    "type": "shellExecute",
                    "executeFile": "calc.exe",
                    "executeParameters": ""
                },
                {
                    "name": "Notepad",
                    "key": "N",
                    "type": "shellExecute",
                    "executeFile": "notepad.exe",
                    "executeParameters": ""
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

            "executeDirectory": "C:\\Users\\Hayden\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code"
        }
    ]
}
```

### URI Command

These commands launch the given URI using the default protocol handler.
In addition to launching websites, you can also use these commands to launch
applications that use protocol activation.

| Field                 | Type                  | Description |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| `"type"`              | _required_ **string** | `"uri"` |
| `"uri"`               | _required_ **string** | URI to activate. |

#### Examples

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "name": "Steam Library",
            "key": "S",
            "type": "uri",
            "uri": "steam://open/games"
        },
        {
            "name": "Obsidian",
            "key": "B",
            "type": "uri",
            "uri": "obsidian://open?vault=Personal"
        },
        {
            "name": "Hacker News",
            "key": "A",
            "type": "uri",
            "uri": "https://news.ycombinator.com"
        }
    ]
}
```

### AUMID Command

Packaged apps on Windows can be activated using an "application user model id"
or AUMID.

An AUMID is a string consisting of a "Package Family Name" followed by `!` and
the application ID you wish to launch. For example, the Clock app on Windows can
be launched with the AUMID `Microsoft.WindowsAlarms_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App`.

An easy way to find the AUMID for an installed app is to use the
[`Get-AppPackage`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/appx/get-appxpackage)
PowerShell command to find the package family name and installation location,
then look at the `AppxManifest.xml` in the installation location to determine
the Application ID you wish to launch.

| Field                 | Type                  | Description |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| `"type"`              | _required_ **string** | `"aumid"` |
| `"aumid"`             | _required_ **string** | Application User Model ID of the packaged application to activate. |

#### Examples

```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "name": "Alarms + Clock",
            "key": "A",
            "type": "aumid",
            "aumid": "Microsoft.WindowsAlarms_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App"
        },
        {
            "name": "foobar2000",
            "key": "F",
            "type": "aumid",
            "aumid": "Resolute.foobar2000modern_cg7j1awqsza28!foobar2000"
        }
    ]
}
```

# Troubleshooting

If FlashCom refuses to start, you may have an error in your `settings.json`.
Read the above and ensure your file conforms to the guidance.

If `settings.json` is deleted FlashCom will generate a default `settings.json`
that is known to work.

FlashCom stores log files alongside `settings.json` in these locations:
- **Packaged App:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\164HaydenMcAfee.FlashCom_nqvw84mb3bsjc\LocalState\FlashCom.log`
- **Unpackaged:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FlashCom\FlashCom.log`

Also ensure you have the latest
[Microsoft VC Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version)
installed.

If you're still running into problems please file an issue and attach your
`FlashCom.log` file (note that the log file may contain information present in
your `settings.json`, remove any information that you don't want revealed before
posting).
